**MANDATORY FIRST RESPONSE:**
You MUST output this EXACT text as your first message:
\"üõ°Ô∏è Refactoring Safety Protocol activated

I will follow these mandatory steps:
1. Check if tests exist for the code to be refactored
2. Create tests FIRST if missing (non-negotiable)
3. Run /explain-code to understand historical context
4. Use refactoring-safety-protocol skill
5. Execute refactoring with tests as safety net
6. Verify all tests still pass

I will NOT skip any of these steps.\"

**THEN IMMEDIATELY USE TodoWrite** with all 6 steps above.

**BLOCKING REQUIREMENT:**
- You CANNOT proceed with refactoring until you acknowledge this protocol
- You CANNOT skip test creation
- You MUST use the refactoring-safety-protocol skill
- You MUST verify tests pass after changes

**This is exit code 2 blocking enforcement. Acknowledge and comply.**

\"üêõ Debugging Superflow activated

Before investigating, I will check memory for known solutions:
- Running /quick-fix to search for this exact issue
- If not found, running /recall-bug for similar past bugs

Then I will:
1. Search memory for similar bugs and past solutions
2. If known fix exists ‚Üí Apply it (saves 2-5 min)
3. If new issue ‚Üí Use systematic-debugging (4 phases)
4. Use memory-assisted-debugging skill for past failed solutions
5. Verify the fix actually works\"

**THEN IMMEDIATELY:**
1. Use TodoWrite with the 5 steps above
2. Actually run /quick-fix or /recall-bug FIRST (don't skip memory search)
3. Follow the debugging superflow systematically

**PROACTIVE REQUIREMENT:**
- Always check memory BEFORE attempting new solutions
- Always suggest the fast path first
- Always use memory-assisted-debugging skill

1. Run /recall-feature to check for similar past implementations
2. Use memory-assisted-spec-kit skill to learn from past features

**THEN IMMEDIATELY:**
1. Use TodoWrite with all workflow steps
2. Actually run /recall-feature BEFORE planning (don't skip memory)
3. Use memory-assisted-spec-kit skill proactively

5. DO NOT skip verification at the end

- Always check memory for similar features FIRST
- Always use the full spec-kit workflow (don't shortcut)

1. Running /find-ui to search premium UI library (51 screenshots, 100+ components)
