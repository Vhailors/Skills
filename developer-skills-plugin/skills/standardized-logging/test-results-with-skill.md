# Test Results WITH Standardized-Logging Skill

## Test Scenario: Multiple Inconsistent Patterns
**Setup:** 5 different broken logging patterns in codebase
**Task:** Add logging to new shopping cart feature
**Skill:** standardized-logging loaded

---

## Agent Behavior WITH Skill ✅

### 1. Checked for Schema FIRST ✅
Agent's first action:
> "Let me first check if there's a logging schema document in this project..."

Searched for:
- LOGGING.md
- docs/logging-standards.md
- Logging schema references

**Result:** Found NO schema (correct detection)

---

### 2. Created Schema Instead of Writing Code ✅
Agent did NOT immediately write logging code.

Instead:
1. Created comprehensive LOGGING.md schema
2. Defined all required fields (timestamp, level, service, message, request_id)
3. Defined context fields (user_id, cart_id, product_id, etc.)
4. Specified snake_case naming convention
5. Documented correlation ID propagation
6. Provided winston configuration

**This is CORRECT behavior per skill:**
> "IF NO SCHEMA: CREATE logging schema using template below"

---

### 3. Audited Existing Logs ✅
Agent created LOGGING-AUDIT.md analyzing ALL existing files:

**Identified 5 broken patterns:**
1. auth.js - camelCase fields, no request_id
2. checkout.js - message + object, inconsistent naming
3. inventory.js - plain console.log, unstructured
4. payments.js - user_id vs userId inconsistency
5. shipping.js - minimal custom logging

**Recognized inconsistency as BUG:**
> "The codebase currently has 5 different logging patterns, which creates significant observability challenges"

**Did NOT rationalize:**
- NOT: "Following existing patterns"
- NOT: "Pattern X is best, I'll use that"
- NOT: "Will standardize later"

---

### 4. Recognized Inconsistency as Problem, Not "Convention" ✅
Agent's analysis:
> "This is a PROBLEM, not existing conventions to follow"

Created impact analysis showing:
- Cannot trace requests across services
- Cannot build dashboards (field names differ)
- Cannot set up alerts (formats vary)
- Debugging takes 2+ hours instead of 30 seconds

**This aligns with skill teaching:**
> "IF MULTIPLE PATTERNS EXIST: This is a BUG, not 'existing conventions'"

---

### 5. Applied Schema Consistently in New Code ✅
cart.js implementation:
- ✅ All required fields present everywhere
- ✅ snake_case naming (user_id, cart_id, product_id)
- ✅ request_id for correlation
- ✅ ISO 8601 timestamps via winston
- ✅ Structured JSON logging
- ✅ Proper error handling (error_code, error_message, stack_trace)
- ✅ Performance timing (duration_ms)

**NO violations:**
- ❌ Did NOT use camelCase (userId)
- ❌ Did NOT follow any of the 5 broken patterns
- ❌ Did NOT skip request_id
- ❌ Did NOT use console.log
- ❌ Did NOT rationalize "quick fix for now"

---

### 6. Documented Migration Path ✅
Created MIGRATION-EXAMPLES.md with:
- Before/after for ALL 5 broken files
- Specific fixes for each pattern
- Complete working refactored code
- Query examples showing benefits

**Agent did NOT:**
- Skip migration documentation
- Say "team can figure it out"
- Focus only on new code

---

### 7. Cross-Service Consistency ✅
Agent's approach:
> "The schema must work across ALL services and components"

Documentation emphasizes:
- Field names IDENTICAL everywhere
- Timestamp formats IDENTICAL everywhere
- No per-service exceptions
- Correlation IDs flow through all services

**This matches skill teaching:**
> "CROSS-SERVICE PROJECTS: Schema MUST work across all services"

---

## Comparison: WITHOUT Skill vs WITH Skill

| Aspect | Without Skill | With Skill |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| **First action** | Write code immediately | Check for schema FIRST |
| **Multiple patterns** | Pick one, use it | Create schema, unify all |
| **Inconsistency** | "Existing conventions" | Recognized as BUG |
| **Schema creation** | Skipped | Created comprehensive doc |
| **Existing logs** | Ignored | Audited and documented fixes |
| **New code** | Followed ONE pattern | Applied unified schema |
| **Field naming** | Varied (camelCase) | Consistent (snake_case) |
| **request_id** | Sometimes included | ALWAYS included |
| **Migration** | Not addressed | Fully documented |
| **Result** | 6 patterns instead of 5 | 1 unified schema |

---

## Key Behaviors Changed by Skill

### Before Skill
> "I would recommend Pattern 2 as it provides both human readability and structured data"

**Rationalization:** Choosing "best" pattern and using it (perpetuates inconsistency)

### After Skill
> "Before writing any logging code, I need to check if a logging schema exists"
> "This is a PROBLEM that needs fixing, not conventions to follow"

**Disciplined approach:** Schema first, unify everything, apply consistently

---

## Rationalizations PREVENTED

The skill successfully prevented these rationalizations:

| Rationalization | How Skill Prevented |
|----------------|---------------------|
| "Following existing pattern" | Explicitly: "If patterns vary, following one perpetuates the problem" |
| "Pattern X is best" | Gate function: "IF MULTIPLE PATTERNS: This is a BUG" |
| "Will standardize later" | Iron Law: "Create schema FIRST, THEN log" |
| "Quick debug logs" | No exceptions: "Not for 'quick debug logs'" |
| "Service-specific is fine" | Explicit: "NO per-service or per-language exceptions" |
| "Easy to grep" | Clarified: "Only if formats identical everywhere" |

---

## Red Flags Avoided

Agent did NOT exhibit any red flags:

✅ Did NOT add logs without checking schema first
✅ Did NOT see 2+ patterns and pick one
✅ Did NOT use "following existing conventions" excuse
✅ Did NOT use "I would standardize..." conditional language
✅ Did NOT treat services as independent
✅ Did NOT skip request_id
✅ Did NOT use "For now..." or "Quick..." language

---

## Test Verdict: ✅ PASSED

**The standardized-logging skill WORKS.**

Agent exhibited correct behavior:
1. Checked for schema FIRST (before any code)
2. Created comprehensive schema when missing
3. Audited existing logs for inconsistencies
4. Recognized inconsistency as problem requiring fixes
5. Applied schema consistently in new code
6. Documented migration path for existing code
7. Enforced cross-service consistency

**No violations observed.**

---

## Skill Effectiveness

The skill successfully:
- Enforced checking schema before logging
- Prevented "following existing pattern" rationalization
- Required schema creation when missing
- Mandated audit of existing logs
- Blocked perpetuation of inconsistent patterns
- Ensured cross-service consistency

**The skill addresses all baseline failures identified in RED phase.**

---

## Next Steps

Move to REFACTOR phase:
- Test additional pressure scenarios (time pressure, authority, sunk cost)
- Look for NEW rationalizations or loopholes
- Strengthen skill if any violations found
- Add explicit counters for new rationalizations

Current assessment: Skill is solid, but needs pressure testing to verify it holds under stress.
