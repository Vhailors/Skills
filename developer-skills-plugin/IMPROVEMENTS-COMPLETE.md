# Superflow System: Complete Improvements

## ‚úÖ All Improvements Implemented

You asked for the system to actually work with hooks, commands, and skills integrated proactively. Here's what was done:

---

## üî¥ 1. EXIT CODE 2 BLOCKING ENFORCEMENT

### Refactoring Safety Protocol
**Before:** Passive suggestion that could be ignored
**After:** EXIT CODE 2 blocking - Claude CANNOT proceed without acknowledging

**What happens now:**
```
User: "Can we refactor the auth module"
‚Üì
Hook BLOCKS with exit code 2
‚Üì
Claude sees this in stderr (forced to process):
"üõ°Ô∏è REFACTORING SAFETY PROTOCOL (ENFORCED)
THIS IS BLOCKING ENFORCEMENT - YOU MUST RESPOND TO THIS MESSAGE

MANDATORY FIRST RESPONSE:
You MUST output this EXACT text:
'üõ°Ô∏è Refactoring Safety Protocol activated

I will follow these mandatory steps:
1. Check if tests exist
2. Create tests FIRST if missing
3. Run /explain-code for context
4. Use refactoring-safety-protocol skill
5. Execute refactoring
6. Verify tests pass

I will NOT skip any steps.'"
‚Üì
Claude must acknowledge and follow
```

### Verification Before Completion
**Before:** Could claim work is done without verification
**After:** EXIT CODE 2 blocking - Must verify before completion

**What happens now:**
```
User: "I'm done with the feature"
‚Üì
Hook BLOCKS with exit code 2
‚Üì
Claude must output:
"‚úÖ Verification Protocol activated

I will NOT mark work as complete until I:
1. Run /check-integration
2. Run /ship-check
3. Use verification-before-completion skill
4. Gather FRESH evidence
5. Confirm ALL tests pass

I will NOT rely on cached results."
‚Üì
Must actually run commands and provide evidence
```

---

## üí™ 2. STRENGTHENED PROACTIVE INSTRUCTIONS

Every superflow now has:

### "YOU MUST START YOUR RESPONSE WITH:"
Forces exact activation message output

### "THEN IMMEDIATELY:"
Explicit action requirements (TodoWrite, commands, skills)

### "ACTUALLY RUN THEM" / "ACTUALLY USE THEM"
Makes it clear these are not optional suggestions

### Examples:

**Debugging Superflow:**
```
"YOU MUST START YOUR RESPONSE WITH:
'üêõ Debugging Superflow activated

Before investigating, I will check memory:
- Running /quick-fix to search for this exact issue
- If not found, running /recall-bug for similar bugs'

THEN IMMEDIATELY:
1. Use TodoWrite with the 5 steps
2. Actually run /quick-fix or /recall-bug FIRST
3. Follow debugging superflow systematically"
```

**Feature Development:**
```
"YOU MUST START YOUR RESPONSE WITH:
'üèóÔ∏è Feature Development Superflow activated

I will follow the complete spec-kit workflow:
1. Run /recall-feature for similar implementations
2. Use memory-assisted-spec-kit
3. Follow: Constitution ‚Üí Specify ‚Üí Clarify ‚Üí Plan'

THEN IMMEDIATELY:
1. Use TodoWrite with all workflow steps
2. Actually run /recall-feature BEFORE planning
3. Use memory-assisted-spec-kit skill proactively"
```

**UI Development:**
```
"IRON LAW: SEARCH BEFORE BUILD
- ALWAYS check /find-ui FIRST
- ALWAYS consider shadcn/ui blocks SECOND
- ONLY build from scratch as last resort"
```

## üéØ 3. SESSION START PROACTIVE MANDATE

Updated `session-start.sh` with critical instructions:

```markdown
## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - Proactive Superflow Usage

YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE RULES FOR EVERY SESSION:

1. WHEN A SUPERFLOW IS ACTIVATED (via hooks):
   - You MUST immediately output the exact activation message
   - You MUST immediately use TodoWrite with all workflow steps
   - You MUST follow the complete workflow (don't skip steps)
   - You MUST use the suggested commands and skills proactively

2. PROACTIVE TOOL USAGE:
   - When hooks suggest /quick-fix, /recall-bug, /recall-feature ‚Üí ACTUALLY RUN THEM
   - When hooks mention skills ‚Üí ACTUALLY USE THEM (not just mention)
   - When hooks suggest /find-ui ‚Üí ACTUALLY SUGGEST IT with a pattern
   - Memory commands are not optional suggestions - use them

3. BLOCKING ENFORCEMENT:
   - Refactoring pattern ‚Üí EXIT CODE 2 BLOCKING (must acknowledge)
   - Completion pattern ‚Üí EXIT CODE 2 BLOCKING (must verify)
   - You CANNOT proceed without acknowledging these

4. VISIBILITY REQUIREMENT:
   - Every superflow activation MUST be visible to the user
   - Format: "[Icon] [Superflow Name] activated" + explanation
   - Then TodoWrite, then execute the workflow
   - This is NOT optional
```

## üß™ Testing the System

### Test 1: Refactoring (Should Block)
```bash
Say: "Can we refactor the authentication system"

Expected behavior:
1. Hook blocks with exit code 2
2. Claude outputs exact activation message
3. Claude creates TodoWrite with 6 steps
4. Claude runs /explain-code
5. Claude checks for tests
6. Claude follows complete protocol
```

### Test 2: Debugging (Should be Proactive)
```bash
Say: "The login feature is broken"

Expected behavior:
1. Claude outputs: "üêõ Debugging Superflow activated"
2. Claude creates TodoWrite
3. Claude ACTUALLY RUNS /quick-fix or /recall-bug
4. Claude uses memory-assisted-debugging skill
5. Claude follows systematic-debugging if needed
```

### Test 3: Feature Development (Should Check Memory First)
```bash
Say: "Let's implement a user dashboard feature"

Expected behavior:
1. Claude outputs: "üèóÔ∏è Feature Development Superflow activated"
2. Claude creates TodoWrite
3. Claude ACTUALLY RUNS /recall-feature
4. Claude uses memory-assisted-spec-kit skill
5. Claude uses spec-kit-orchestrator
6. Claude verifies with /check-integration before claiming done
```

### Test 4: UI Development (Should Search First)
```bash
Say: "Build a pricing table component"

Expected behavior:
1. Claude outputs: "üé® UI Development Superflow activated"
2. Claude creates TodoWrite
3. Claude ACTUALLY SUGGESTS /find-ui pricing
4. Claude checks shadcn/ui blocks
5. Claude only builds from scratch if nothing found
```

### Test 5: Completion (Should Block)
```bash
Say: "I think we're done with this feature"

Expected behavior:
1. Hook blocks with exit code 2
2. Claude outputs verification message
3. Claude creates TodoWrite
4. Claude ACTUALLY RUNS /check-integration
5. Claude ACTUALLY RUNS /ship-check
6. Claude provides fresh evidence
7. Only then marks as complete
```

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

### 1. Reinstall Plugin
```bash
/plugin uninstall developer-skills@local-dev-skills
/plugin install developer-skills@local-dev-skills
# Restart Claude Code
```

### 2. Verify Hooks Load
Check for:
```
UserPromptSubmit:Callback hook success: Success
```

### 3. Test with Trigger Words
- "refactor" ‚Üí Should block and force acknowledgment
- "bug" ‚Üí Should output activation + run /quick-fix
- "implement feature" ‚Üí Should output activation + run /recall-feature
- "done" ‚Üí Should block and force verification

### 4. Monitor Compliance
- Every superflow should output activation message
- Every superflow should create TodoWrite
- Commands should actually be run
- Skills should actually be used
