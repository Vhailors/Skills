# ðŸ”„ Session Continuity (Auto-Loaded)

## Active Superflows System

You have access to 8 intelligent superflows through the developer-skills plugin:

1. **Feature Development** - Spec-kit â†’ Implementation â†’ Verification
2. **Debugging** - Memory search â†’ Systematic investigation â†’ Fix
3. **Refactoring** - Tests required â†’ Safety protocol â†’ Verification
4. **UI Development** - Library search â†’ shadcn/ui â†’ Error handling
5. **Pre-Ship Validation** - Integration check â†’ Ship check â†’ Changelog
6. **Rapid Prototyping** - Build vs buy â†’ Fast implementation â†’ Quality
7. **Session Start** - Load context â†’ Resume work (this one!)
8. **Skill Creation** - TDD enforcement â†’ Test â†’ Write â†’ Verify

## ðŸ“‹ Pattern-Based Activation

The system automatically detects patterns in user prompts and injects relevant workflow guidance:
- **\"refactor\"** â†’ Refactoring Safety Protocol (ENFORCED)
- **\"bug/error\"** â†’ Debugging Superflow with memory search
- **\"implement feature\"** â†’ Feature Development with spec-kit
- **\"ui/component\"** â†’ UI Development with library search
- **\"done/complete\"** â†’ Verification enforcement
- **\"mvp/prototype\"** â†’ Rapid Prototyping guidance

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Principles

- **Memory First**: Always search claude-mem for similar past work
- **Tests Required**: NO refactoring without tests (IRON LAW)
- **Verify Before Complete**: NO completion claims without evidence
- **Library Before Build**: Check /find-ui and shadcn/ui first
