# Developer Skills Plugin: Current Status

## ✅ What's Actually Working

### Hook System (5 Scripts, All Active)

**1. SessionStart Hook** (`session-start.sh`)
- ✅ Triggers every session start
- ✅ Injects superflow awareness
- ✅ Shows 8 available superflows with icons
- ✅ Reminds about visibility requirements

**2. UserPromptSubmit Hook** (`analyze-prompt.sh`)
- ✅ Pattern detection on every user message
- ✅ Detects 9+ patterns (refactor, bug, feature, ui, api, complete, mvp, explain, pattern)
- ✅ Injects workflow-specific instructions
- ✅ **NOW ENFORCES**: Immediate output + TodoWrite for all superflows

**3. PreToolUse Hook for Logging** (`check-logging.sh`)
- ✅ Triggers before Write/Edit operations
- ✅ Detects logging code (log|logger|console.)
- ✅ Injects IRON LAW: Check schema first

**4. PreToolUse Hook for Git** (`detect-git-operations.sh`)
- ✅ Triggers before git commit/push/add
- ✅ Injects pre-ship validation checklist
- ✅ Suggests /ship-check and /check-integration

**5. PostToolUse Hook for Tests** (`verify-tests.sh`)
- ✅ Triggers after test/build/lint commands
- ✅ Enforces evidence-based verification
- ✅ Reminds to read actual output

### Evidence Hooks Are Working

You can see in system-reminders:
```
UserPromptSubmit:Callback hook success: Success
```

This confirms hooks are loading and executing.

## 🎯 What Hooks Actually Do

### Context Injection (Not Auto-Execution)

Hooks **CANNOT**:
- ❌ Auto-execute slash commands like `/ship-check`
- ❌ Auto-run skills automatically
- ❌ Force command execution

Hooks **CAN** (and DO):
- ✅ Inject markdown instructions into Claude's context
- ✅ Use strong enforcement language (IRON LAW)
- ✅ Suggest commands at appropriate times
- ✅ Pattern-match user prompts
- ✅ Provide pre/post tool use reminders

## 🔄 How Superflows Actually Work

### Example: Refactoring Superflow

**1. User says**: "I need to refactor the auth module"

**2. Hook triggers**: `UserPromptSubmit` → `analyze-prompt.sh`

**3. Pattern detected**: "refactor"

**4. Context injected**:
```markdown
## 🛡️ REFACTORING SAFETY PROTOCOL (ENFORCED)

**IRON LAW: NO REFACTORING WITHOUT TESTS**

**REQUIRED ACTIONS (DO NOT SKIP):**
1. **IMMEDIATELY OUTPUT** to user: "🛡️ Refactoring Safety Protocol activated"
2. **IMMEDIATELY USE TodoWrite** with these steps:
   - Check if tests exist for code to refactor
   - Create tests first if missing (non-negotiable)
   - Run /explain-code for historical context
   - Use refactoring-safety-protocol skill
   - Execute refactoring changes
   - Verify tests still pass
```

**5. Claude sees this** and should:
- Output the activation message
- Create TodoWrite with steps
- Follow the workflow

## 📊 Superflow Coverage

All 8 superflows are covered through context injection:

| Superflow | Hook | Pattern | Status |
|-----------|------|---------|--------|
| 🏗️ Feature Development | UserPromptSubmit | "implement\|build\|create feature" | ✅ Active |
| 🐛 Debugging | UserPromptSubmit | "bug\|error\|issue" | ✅ Active |
| 🛡️ Refactoring | UserPromptSubmit | "refactor\|rewrite" | ✅ **ENFORCED** |
| 🎨 UI Development | UserPromptSubmit | "ui\|component" | ✅ Active |
| 🔌 API Contract Design | UserPromptSubmit | "api.*change" | ✅ Active |
| ✅ Pre-Ship Validation | PreToolUse(git) | git commit/push | ✅ Active |
| 🚀 Rapid Prototyping | UserPromptSubmit | "mvp\|prototype" | ✅ Active |
| 🔄 Session Start | SessionStart | (automatic) | ✅ Active |

## 🚧 What Was Fixed

### Before (Incorrect Documentation)
- SUPERFLOWS.md claimed hooks could "auto-run" commands
- Said things like "SessionStart → Auto-run /continue-work"
- Described impossible features like "OnError → Auto-trigger /quick-fix"
- Created unrealistic expectations

### After (Accurate Documentation)
- SUPERFLOWS.md now describes context injection accurately
- Changed "auto-run" to "injects instructions"
- Removed fake hook types (OnError, BeforeRefactor, etc.)
- Shows what hooks actually can and cannot do

### Visibility Enhancement
- Added "REQUIRED ACTIONS" to all 7 pattern-based superflows
- Forces Claude to output activation message
- Requires TodoWrite with workflow steps
- Format: "🛡️ [Superflow Name] activated"

## 🧪 Testing

### How to Verify Hooks Work

**Test 1: Refactoring Detection**
```
Say: "Can we refactor some code"
Expected: Hook injects IRON LAW enforcement
Claude should output: "🛡️ Refactoring Safety Protocol activated"
```

**Test 2: Bug Detection**
```
Say: "Login is broken"
Expected: Hook injects Debugging Superflow
Claude should output: "🐛 Debugging Superflow activated"
```

**Test 3: Feature Detection**
```
Say: "Implement user profile feature"
Expected: Hook injects Feature Development workflow
Claude should output: "🏗️ Feature Development Superflow activated"
```

**Test 4: Git Commit**
```
Run: git commit -m "test"
Expected: Hook injects pre-ship checklist
```

### Evidence Hooks Are Running

Look for system-reminders in responses:
```
UserPromptSubmit:Callback hook success: Success
```

This confirms the hook executed successfully.

## 🎯 Next Steps for Users

1. **Reinstall plugin** (if you haven't yet):
   ```bash
   /plugin uninstall developer-skills@local-dev-skills
   /plugin install developer-skills@local-dev-skills
   # Restart Claude Code
   ```

2. **Test with trigger words**:
   - Say "refactor" → Should see 🛡️ activation
   - Say "bug" → Should see 🐛 activation
   - Say "implement feature" → Should see 🏗️ activation

3. **Verify visibility**:
   - Each superflow should output activation message
   - Each should create TodoWrite with steps
   - You should see the workflow in action

## 🎯 Next Steps for Development

### Potential Enhancements

1. **Stronger Enforcement** - Use exit code 2 (blocking) for critical workflows
2. **Dynamic Patterns** - Load patterns from `.claude/patterns.json`
3. **Project-Specific** - Detect project conventions from config
4. **Memory Integration** - Query claude-mem for relevant patterns

### Not Possible with Hooks

- ❌ Auto-executing commands (hooks can't do this)
- ❌ Running skills automatically (not supported)
- ❌ Forcing workflow execution (can only suggest strongly)

## 📖 Related Documentation

- [SUPERFLOWS.md](./SUPERFLOWS.md) - Complete superflow definitions (NOW ACCURATE)
- [hooks/README.md](./hooks/README.md) - Complete hooks documentation
- [hooks/SUPERFLOW-VISIBILITY.md](./hooks/SUPERFLOW-VISIBILITY.md) - Visibility requirements
- [hooks/HOOK-MAPPING.md](./hooks/HOOK-MAPPING.md) - Implementation mapping

## ✅ Summary

**The system IS working.** The gap was between:
- **Aspirational documentation** (SUPERFLOWS.md claimed auto-execution)
- **Actual implementation** (hooks inject context, don't auto-execute)

**Now fixed:** SUPERFLOWS.md accurately describes what hooks do - context injection with strong enforcement language, not automatic command execution.

**Result:** A fully functional superflow system that guides Claude through best-practice workflows via intelligent context injection.
