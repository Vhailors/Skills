# UI Library Search

You are running the `/find-ui` command to search the premium UI library for components and inspirations.

## Your Task

Use the **ui-inspiration-finder** skill to search the UI library:

@developer-skills-plugin/skills/ui-inspiration-finder/SKILL.md

## Search Query

Pattern: **$ARGUMENTS**

If no pattern provided, ask the user: "What UI pattern are you looking for? (e.g., testimonials, hero, pricing, cards, navigation)"

## Search Strategy

### Step 1: Load the Index

Read the UI inspiration index:

```
C:\Users\Dominik\Documents\UI\ui-inspiration-index.json
```

### Step 2: Multi-Strategy Search

Search the index using ALL these strategies and combine results:

**A) Search by UI Pattern** (in `screenshots[].ui_patterns[]`):
- Look for patterns matching: $ARGUMENTS
- Common patterns: `testimonial-cards`, `hero`, `pricing-table`, `feature-grid`, `masonry-grid`, `bento-grid`, `navigation`, `form`, `card`, `modal`, `carousel`

**B) Search by Category** (in `screenshots[].category`):
- Look for: `"$ARGUMENTS"` in category field
- Common categories: `testimonials/social-proof`, `hero`, `pricing`, `features`, `navigation`, `forms`

**C) Search by Use Case** (in `screenshots[].use_cases[]`):
- Look for use cases containing: $ARGUMENTS
- Examples: `building credibility`, `displaying customer testimonials`, `pricing display`, `showcasing achievements`

**D) Search by Tags** (in `screenshots[].tags[]`):
- Look for tags containing: $ARGUMENTS

**E) Search by Related Components** (in `screenshots[].related_components[]`):
- Look for component names containing: $ARGUMENTS

### Step 3: Present Results

For each match found, display:

```markdown
## Found: [screenshot.title]

**Source:** [screenshot.source] (e.g., Clay, Doist, Firefox)
**Category:** [screenshot.category]
**Visual:** [screenshot.path]

**Description:**

**UI Patterns:**

**Related Components:**
- [list component names from related_components]
  - Location: C:\Users\Dominik\Documents\UI\components\[component-name]\

**Quality Indicators:**
- [list quality_indicators]

---
```

### Step 4: Component Details

If related components exist, offer to show their implementation:

```markdown
### Available Implementations

I found [N] components that implement this pattern:

1. **[component-name]** - [brief description from index or file]
   - Location: `C:\Users\Dominik\Documents\UI\components\[component-name]\`
   - Files: [list files in directory]

Would you like me to:
- Show the component implementation?
- Help adapt it to your project?
- Compare multiple options?
```

### Step 5: No Results Handling

If no exact matches found, suggest alternatives:

```markdown
## No exact matches for "$ARGUMENTS"

**Similar patterns in the library:**
- [list 3-5 closest matches based on similar tags/categories]

**Did you mean:**
- [suggest common patterns that might match]
  - testimonials → testimonial-cards, animated_testimonials
  - buttons → CTA buttons, navigation buttons
  - forms → input fields, form validation
  - pricing → pricing-table, subscription plans

**What's in the library:**
- [Show count by category: X testimonials, Y hero sections, Z pricing examples]
```
