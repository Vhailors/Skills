# Refactoring Safety Protocol

## Overview

**Never refactor without a safety net. Tests are not optional.**

This skill enforces systematic safety checks before and during refactoring. It prevents breaking working code through empirical validation, historical context, and incremental changes.

**Core principle:** Logical reasoning about correctness is not enough. Tests must prove behavior is preserved.

**The Iron Law:**
```
NO REFACTORING WITHOUT TESTS
NO TESTS = WRITE TESTS FIRST
NO EXCEPTIONS
```

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- **Refactoring existing code** - Making structural changes without changing behavior
- **Cleaning up code** - Simplifying, extracting, renaming
- **Performance optimization** - Changing implementation for speed
- **Updating patterns** - Modernizing code (callbacks ‚Üí async/await, etc.)
- **User says "refactor"** - Any refactoring request

**Triggers:**
- "Refactor", "simplify", "clean up", "extract", "rename"
- "Make this more readable", "modernize this code"
- "Optimize", "improve performance"
- Before modifying working code

**DO NOT use for:**
- New features (use spec-kit-orchestrator)
- Bug fixes (use systematic-debugging)
- First implementation (nothing to refactor yet)

## Prerequisites

**Before ANY refactoring:**
- Code is working (not broken)
- Tests exist OR can be written
- Have memory/context access (claude-mem if available)

**Integration:**
- Works WITH memory-assisted-debugging (check history)
- Works WITH verification-before-completion (prove tests pass)
- Works WITH spec-kit-orchestrator (if refactor changes behavior)

## The Safety Protocol (8 Mandatory Steps)

### Step 1: STOP - Check for Tests FIRST

**BEFORE touching any code:**

```bash
# Search for test files related to code being refactored
find . -name "*[filename]*test*"
find . -name "*[filename]*spec*"
grep -r "describe.*[FunctionName]" tests/
```

**Three outcomes:**

**A) Tests exist** ‚úÖ
- Proceed to Step 2

**B) Tests don't exist** ‚ùå
- **STOP refactoring immediately**
- Say: "I cannot safely refactor without tests. Let me write tests first."
- Write tests that cover current behavior
- Verify tests pass with current implementation
- THEN proceed to Step 2

**C) Unsure if tests exist** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Ask user: "Are there tests for this code?"
- If no: Go to B (write tests first)
- If yes: Find them, verify they pass

**No exceptions to this rule:**
- "It's a simple refactor" ‚Üí Still need tests
- "I'm confident it's correct" ‚Üí Confidence ‚â† proof
- "The tests are elsewhere" ‚Üí Find and verify them
- "I'll test manually" ‚Üí Manual testing ‚â† automated safety net

### Step 2: Search Memory for Context

**Before changing code, understand WHY it was written this way:**

**Query memory (if available):**
```
mcp__claude_mem__search_observations("[filename]")
mcp__claude_mem__find_by_file("[filepath]")
mcp__claude_mem__search_user_prompts("refactor [function-name]")
```

**Look for:**
- Design decisions: "Why this pattern?"
- Past attempts: "Was this refactored before?"
- Known issues: "What bugs were fixed here?"
- Edge cases: "What special cases does this handle?"

**If memory unavailable:**
- Check git history: `git log -p [filepath]`
- Check commit messages: `git blame [filepath]`
- Look for code comments explaining rationale

**Red flags from memory:**
- "Tried X, caused bug, reverted"
- "This handles edge case Y"
- "Performance optimization, don't change"
- "Subtle behavior, be careful"

**If found ‚Üí incorporate into refactoring plan**

### Step 3: Identify All Dependencies

**Find who uses this code:**

```bash
# Search for all usages
grep -r "functionName" . --exclude-dir=node_modules
rg "functionName" --type js

# For imports/requires
grep -r "import.*filename" .
grep -r "require.*filename" .
```

**Document:**
- How many files use this?
- What are the call patterns?
- Are there edge case usages?
- Will refactor affect callers?

**If breaking callers:**
- Update ALL callers in same refactor
- OR change approach to preserve interface

### Step 4: Run Tests (Baseline)

**BEFORE any changes, verify current tests pass:**

```bash
npm test [test-file]
pytest tests/test_[module].py
cargo test [test-name]
```

**Expected outcome:** All tests pass ‚úÖ

**If tests fail:**
- **STOP refactoring**
- Code is already broken
- Fix failing tests first
- THEN refactor

**Record baseline:**
- Test count: "12 tests passing"
- Performance (if relevant): "Runs in 45ms"

### Step 5: Incremental Refactoring

**Make changes in SMALL, verifiable steps:**

**Bad approach:**
- Refactor entire file at once
- Make 20 changes simultaneously
- Test at the end

**Good approach:**
- Change ONE thing
- Run tests immediately
- If pass ‚Üí commit
- If fail ‚Üí revert, understand why
- Proceed to next change

**Example incremental approach:**

```
Step 5a: Extract helper function
  ‚Üí Run tests ‚Üí Pass ‚úÖ ‚Üí Commit

Step 5b: Replace first usage with helper
  ‚Üí Run tests ‚Üí Pass ‚úÖ ‚Üí Commit

Step 5c: Replace second usage with helper
  ‚Üí Run tests ‚Üí Pass ‚úÖ ‚Üí Commit

Step 5d: Remove old inline code
  ‚Üí Run tests ‚Üí Pass ‚úÖ ‚Üí Commit
```

**Each commit is a safe rollback point.**

### Step 6: Run Tests (After Each Change)

**After EVERY incremental change:**

```bash
# Run the same test command as Step 4
npm test [test-file]
```

**Required outcomes:**
- ‚úÖ Same number of tests pass
- ‚úÖ No new failures
- ‚úÖ Performance comparable (if relevant)

**If tests fail:**
- **DO NOT PROCEED**
- Revert the change: `git checkout [file]`
- Understand why it failed
- Fix approach
- Try again

**If tests pass:**
- ‚úÖ Commit: `git commit -m "refactor: [specific change]"`
- Document: "Step 5a complete, tests passing"
- Proceed to next incremental change

### Step 7: Verify Behavior Preservation

**After all changes complete, comprehensive validation:**

**A) All tests still pass**
```bash
# Run FULL test suite (not just affected tests)
npm test
```

**B) No regressions introduced**
- Check test coverage didn't decrease
- Verify edge cases still handled
- Confirm performance not degraded

**C) Compare before/after**
```markdown
## Refactor Summary

**Before:**
- 12 tests passing
- Function complexity: 8
- Performance: 45ms

**After:**
- 12 tests passing ‚úÖ (same count)
- Function complexity: 4 ‚úÖ (improved)
- Performance: 43ms ‚úÖ (comparable)

**Behavior preserved:** Yes, all tests pass
```

### Step 8: Document Changes and Rollback Plan

**Create clear commit with rollback instructions:**

```bash
git commit -m "refactor: simplify validateUser function

- Reduced cyclomatic complexity from 8 to 4
- Preserved all edge case handling (id===0)
- Tests: 12/12 passing
- Performance: comparable (45ms ‚Üí 43ms)

Rollback: git revert HEAD if issues found
Verified: All tests passing, no behavior change"
```

**Provide rollback instructions:**
```markdown
## If Issues Found

**Immediate rollback:**
git revert [commit-hash]

**Specific file rollback:**
git checkout [previous-commit] [filepath]

**Verification after rollback:**
npm test  # Should all pass
```

## Common Mistakes

### ‚ùå "It's a simple refactor, don't need tests"
**Reality:** Simple refactors break too. Tests are ALWAYS required.

**Fix:** No exceptions. Write tests if they don't exist.

### ‚ùå "I'll test manually after"
**Reality:** Manual testing catches obvious breaks, misses subtle regressions.

**Fix:** Automated tests are non-negotiable. Manual testing is supplementary.

### ‚ùå "Tests exist but I didn't run them"
**Reality:** You don't know if your refactor broke anything.

**Fix:** Run tests before AND after. Both times. No exceptions.

### ‚ùå "Logical reasoning proves it's correct"
**Reality:** Edge cases, race conditions, and subtle bugs defy logical reasoning.

**Fix:** Trust tests, not logic. Empirical validation required.

### ‚ùå "Refactored everything at once"
**Reality:** When tests fail, impossible to identify which change broke it.

**Fix:** Incremental changes with tests after each. One change = one commit.

### ‚ùå "Tests failed but I'm confident"
**Reality:** Confidence ‚â† correctness. Tests found a real issue.

**Fix:** Never override failing tests. Understand why, fix approach.

## Red Flags - STOP Immediately

**If you think:**
- "Tests aren't necessary for this"
- "I'm confident this is correct"
- "It's just a cleanup, can't break anything"
- "I'll make all changes then test"
- "Tests failed but it's probably fine"
- "No tests exist, but I'll be careful"

**All of these mean:** You're about to break working code. STOP and follow the protocol.

## Refactoring Decision Tree

```
User requests refactor
    ‚îÇ
    ‚Üì
Do tests exist?
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Run tests (baseline)
    ‚îÇ         ‚îÇ
    ‚îÇ         ‚îú‚îÄ PASS ‚Üí Continue to memory search
    ‚îÇ         ‚îî‚îÄ FAIL ‚Üí STOP, fix tests first
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí STOP
             ‚îÇ
             Say: "Cannot refactor without tests"
             ‚îÇ
             Write tests for current behavior
             ‚îÇ
             Verify tests pass
             ‚îÇ
             THEN continue to memory search
```

## Example: Safe Refactoring Flow

**User:** "Refactor the calculateDiscount function"

**Step 1: Check for tests**
```bash
grep -r "calculateDiscount" tests/
# Found: tests/pricing.test.js
```
‚úÖ Tests exist

**Step 2: Search memory**
```
mcp__claude_mem__search_observations("calculateDiscount")
# Found: Session #45 - "Added special handling for bulk orders"
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Preserve bulk order logic

**Step 3: Identify dependencies**
```bash
grep -r "calculateDiscount" .
# Found in: cart.js, checkout.js, invoice.js (3 files)
```
üìù 3 callers identified

**Step 4: Run baseline tests**
```bash
npm test tests/pricing.test.js
# ‚úÖ 8 tests passing
```

**Step 5: Incremental refactor**
```javascript
// Step 5a: Extract bulk discount logic
function getBulkDiscount(quantity) {
  return quantity >= 10 ? 0.15 : 0;
}
```
Run tests ‚Üí ‚úÖ Pass ‚Üí Commit

```javascript
// Step 5b: Use helper in calculateDiscount
function calculateDiscount(price, quantity) {
  const bulkDiscount = getBulkDiscount(quantity);
  // ... rest of logic
}
```
Run tests ‚Üí ‚úÖ Pass ‚Üí Commit

**Step 6: Verify after each change**
```bash
npm test tests/pricing.test.js
# ‚úÖ 8 tests passing (same as baseline)
```

**Step 7: Final validation**
```bash
npm test  # All tests
# ‚úÖ All 45 tests passing
```

**Step 8: Document and commit**
```bash
git commit -m "refactor: extract bulk discount calculation

- Extracted getBulkDiscount helper for reusability
- Preserves bulk order logic from session #45
- Tests: 8/8 passing
- No behavior change

Rollback: git revert HEAD"
```

‚úÖ **Safe refactoring complete**

## Integration with Other Skills

**Use BEFORE refactoring:**
- **memory-assisted-debugging:** Check for past issues with this code
- **verification-before-completion:** Establish baseline tests pass

**Use DURING refactoring:**
- **This skill:** Follow 8-step protocol

**Use AFTER refactoring:**
- **verification-before-completion:** Prove tests still pass
- **full-stack-integration-checker:** If refactor affects multiple layers

## Real-World Impact

**Without this protocol:**
- Break working code
- Introduce subtle regressions
- Discover issues in production
- Spend hours fixing "simple" refactors
- Lose trust in refactoring

**With this protocol:**
- Safe refactoring with confidence
- Catch issues before commit
- Preserve all behavior
- Easy rollback if needed
- Refactor fearlessly

**Time investment:** +10-20 min for protocol
**Time saved:** Hours of debugging broken refactors

## Quick Reference

**Before ANY refactoring:**
- [ ] Check if tests exist
- [ ] If no tests: Write tests first
- [ ] Search memory for context
- [ ] Identify all dependencies
- [ ] Run baseline tests (must pass)

**During refactoring:**
- [ ] Make incremental changes (one at a time)
- [ ] Run tests after EACH change
- [ ] Commit each successful change
- [ ] Revert if tests fail

**After refactoring:**
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Verify behavior preserved
- [ ] Compare before/after metrics
- [ ] Document changes + rollback plan
- [ ] ONLY THEN claim "refactored successfully"
